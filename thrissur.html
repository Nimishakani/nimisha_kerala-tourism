                    Located 60 km from the Thrissur district of Kerala, Athirappilly Falls is a marvellous cascade of frothy waters that makes its way from the Anamudi mountains of the Western Ghats. Also called as Bahubali Waterfall, this 80 ft high and 330 ft wide marvel is the largest waterfall in Kerala. It is often referred to as the "Niagara Falls of India". From here, the Athirappilly falls flows through the verdant greenery of Vazhachal Forest toward the Arabian Sea, creating a spectacular vista of scintillating water, emerald jungles and azure sky.

It is when one sets foot on its coast that they realize the reason the beach is known as Snehatheeram (meaning love shore). It is impossible for the person coming here to not fall in love with the music of the sea waves hitting the against the shore softly while watching the sun disappearing in water.
